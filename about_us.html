                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The people are sovereign- they are the highest form of political authority. Power flows from the people
                    to the leaders of government. The leader should power till the time they hold the democratic consent of
                    the governed. And the consent of the governed is secured through periodic elections held in free and
                    fair environment. In fact, people elect their representatives at local, provincial and national levels by
                    exercising their democratic franchise rights. The elected representatives at the national, sub- national
                    and local levels should listen to their constituents– the people- and respond to their needs and voices.
                    Election, in fact, performs as a self-corrective system. Political parties review their performance and
                    behaviour on the basis of the vote they do receive in elections. Key role of citizens in a democracy is to
                    take part in elections which should necessarily be conducted in a free and fair environment. Besides,
                    citizens should participate in public spheres as maker and shaper of public values, goods and services.
                    Citizens, therefore, need to be informed, educated about civic issues for effective participation in public
                    spheres and watch critically as democratic watchdog as to how political leaders, representatives and
                    administrative/government authority use or abuse their powers. Needless to say, free and fair periodic
                    election is the bedrock of democracy. What is important, in a democracy, is not only strong democratic
                    institutions like Election Commission, public service commission, national human rights institution but
                    also empowered citizenry with independent and unencumbered agency to perform meaningfully an
                    active role in the process of democratizing democracy. In fact, it may be possible to have democratic
                    institutions in the high politics of the state but allowing profound injustice or irresponsibility to exist in
                    the deep local politics of the society. It is therefore critical to strengthen local democracy that matters to
                    the life of the citizens. </p>
