                  <h2>STRENGTHENING PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY</h2>
                   <p>CIVIC EDUCATION FOR ENHANCING DEMOCRATIC COMPETENCE OF WOMEN AND MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IN NEPAL</p> 
                   <b>CLIENT: TAIWAN FOUNDATION FOR DEMOCRACY</b>
                   <br>
                   <p>Date: 2025</p>
                  <p> <b>Key objectives and Key Activities:</b> Nepal, a democratic republic, has constitutionally guaranteed the
rights of its people and ensured equality. Democracy was officially established in 1990, along with the
recognition of fundamental human rights. However, the present situation remains largely unchanged
yet. There are still many challenges that pose threat to democracy in Nepal. Undoubtedly Nepal has
come a long way in its journey of democracy. Nevertheless, sustaining its democratic gains is still a
challenge. Strengthening democratic institutions, promoting transparency, and fostering dialogue
between citizens, communities as well as political forces are essential for rebuilding public trust and
confidence in the democratic process. This will happen only when citizens are aware of their rights and
entitlements enough and can participate in open and critical dialogues in matters and concerning their
civic interests. In the rural and semi urban area, the women are still viewed as subordinate citizen.
Moreover, they lack awareness of democratic provision and their entitlements guaranteed by the
Constitution, Acts and regulations. In fact, women and marginalized communities can strengthen their
voices and actively participate and exercise their democratic rights only when they are aware of them
and know the way how to enjoy and use these rights. Democracy dialogues at the grassroots have been
the effective way to impart t awareness and empower rural citizen in Nepal. Democracy education plays
a vital role in empowering women to understand their rights, participate in civic life, and advocate for
equality within society. By providing knowledge of democratic principles, legal rights, and political
processes, it enables women to become politically aware, actively engaged, and capable of holding
leaders accountable. This fosters a more inclusive and just society where women’s voices contribute to
shaping policies on critical issues.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p> Keeping this fact into account, DECoN carried out the action titled “Strengthening Participatory
                    Democracy- Civic Education for enhancing Democratic Competence of Women and Marginalized
                    Communities in Nepal&quot; to educate people especially the women and marginalized communities about
                    their rights enshrined in the constitution in general and local government operation act 2017 in
                    particular. DECoN worked together with the community stakeholders to contribute towards enhancing
                    rural women&#39;s capacity to enhance local democracy, legal and constitutional rights of citizens. DECoN in
                    collaboration with local stakeholders in Kapilvastu and Rupandehi, has carried out the action to
                    contribute strengthen democracy and human rights- Enhancing knowledge of democratic and human
                    rights systems, such as through capacity- building of communities.</p> <br>
                    
                    <p>The overall objective of the action is to strengthen democracy at the local level in Nepal. The specific
objectives are: <br>(i) to raise awareness among women and marginalized communities about constitutional
and legal rights, and to enhance their civic roles through community dialogues at the local level and <br>(ii)
to improve knowledge of the democratic system, civic rights, inclusion, and participation by building the
capacity of rural women.</p> <br>
<p>The project was implemented in four local governments- Banaganga Municipality and Kapilvastu
Municipality of Kapilvastu District, and Sainamaina Municipality and Suddhodan Rural Municipality of
Rupandehi District. These areas were selected considering the need to enhance civic awareness and
participation among women and marginalized communities at the local level. DECoN carried out the
project with a strong focus on Civic Awareness Dialogues, designed to educate rural women about the
democratic system, civic rights and entitlements, participation, and inclusion. The aim was to strengthen
women’s capacity to claim and exercise their rights at the local level. The project was implemented in
collaboration with local organizations, particularly Lumbini Development Citizen Forum (LDCF) and
among others, which jointly organized the dialogues as civic education meetings. Trained facilitators
were responsible for leading these sessions.</p> <br>
<p>In total, 12 Civic Awareness Dialogues (three in each of the four municipalities) were conducted. These
dialogues helped deepen awareness and understanding among women and marginalized communities
on key aspects of participatory democracy, including citizens’ legal rights, electoral processes,
participation and inclusion, local governance services, and the delivery mechanisms of local
governments. Through these dialogues, participants were directly empowered with knowledge of
participatory democracy, citizen engagement, social accountability, and local governance. They also
learned practical ways to engage with agencies, voice their concerns, and demand services and facilities
from local governments. </p> <br>
<p>To support the objectives, the project also designed and produced IEC materials, including booklets
(resource materials) and flipcharts/flex charts, to strengthen participants’ knowledge of democratic
rights, legal and constitutional provisions, and meaningful participation. A post-dialogue review meeting
with local partners and facilitators found that the dialogues were highly effective in empowering women
and marginalized groups. As a result, networks of women and marginalized communities have been
formed and strengthened to raise issues of local democracy. These networks are expected to play an
instrumental role in building collective civic capacity at the local level. However, follow-up refresher
sessions and orientations will be necessary to ensure their sustained engagement. Overall, such civic
awareness dialogues are vital for empowering women and advancing their entitlements in a patriarchal
society like Nepal. This intervention has been instrumental in empowering women and marginalized
groups by increasing their awareness of democratic rights and entitlements, thereby contributing to the promotion of participatory democracy in the country. Similar initiatives need to be scaled up and
systematically implemented in rural municipalities across the country to foster inclusive democratic
participation and stronger local governance.
